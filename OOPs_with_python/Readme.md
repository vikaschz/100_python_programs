# OOPs with Python

A structured collection of Python programs demonstrating core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. Each folder focuses on one principle and contains simple, clear examples for learning and revision.

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
OOPs-with-python/
│
├── class/
├── encapsulation/

├── abstraction/
└── README.md
```

## 🧩 What Each Folder Contains

### **1. class/**

Basic introduction to classes and objects:

* Creating classes
* Defining attributes and methods
* Example programs

### **2. encapsulation/**

Covers restricting data access:

* Private variables (`__variable`)
* Getter and setter methods
* Controlled access to internal data

### **3. inheritance/**

Shows how one class can reuse and extend another:

* Single inheritance
* Method overriding
* Using superclasses

### **4. polymorphism/**

Demonstrates how different classes can share method names:

* Method overriding
* Same method, different behavior
* Real-world examples

### **5. abstraction/**

Focuses on hiding implementation details:

* Abstract classes
* Abstract methods (using `abc` module)
* Clean interfaces
